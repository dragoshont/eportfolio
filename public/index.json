[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"About Me I am Dragos Hont, a resilient and systems-oriented learner based in Bucharest, Romania. This e-portfolio documents my academic journey through the MSc Artificial Intelligence programme at the University of Essex Online.\nMy academic and professional interests include:\nArtificial Intelligence \u0026amp; Machine Learning – workflow mining, specification-driven development, and applied AI Structured Workflows – modular, checklist-driven approaches to technical and everyday tasks Responsible AI \u0026amp; Governance – ethical considerations and best practices in AI deployment Culinary \u0026amp; Creative Experimentation – applying iterative refinement and modular thinking beyond computing This portfolio reflects my commitment to rigorous, reproducible work and my adaptability across technical and practical domains.\nBackground For over 15 years, I’ve been a hands-on software engineering leader, building robust systems across finance, banking, energy, compliance, and security. Those years in the code, solving diverse problems in complex domains, taught me the fundamentals of system design, the importance of clean architecture, and the discipline of seeing projects through from conception to production release.\nMy focus has evolved from solving problems with code to solving them through people – empowering developers, creating environments where they can do their best work, and building teams that are more than the sum of their parts.\nBeyond Technology When I’m not exploring AI and machine learning concepts, I’m planning the next adventure with my family. We love to create things together, whether it’s a piece of software to plan our next trip or experimenting with new approaches to everyday challenges.\nLet’s Connect I’m always open to connecting with fellow learners, researchers, and tech enthusiasts. Feel free to reach out through any of the channels above.\n","date":1734134400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1734134400,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://dragoshont.github.io/eportfolio/author/dragos-hont/","publishdate":"2024-12-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/eportfolio/author/dragos-hont/","section":"authors","summary":"About Me I am Dragos Hont, a resilient and systems-oriented learner based in Bucharest, Romania.
