## Dragos Hont – MSc Artificial Intelligence e‑Portfolio

### Overview
Welcome to my e‑portfolio. This repository documents my academic journey through the MSc Artificial Intelligence programme at the University of Essex Online. It serves as both a reflective record of my learning and a showcase of my technical, creative, and professional development.

The portfolio aligns with programme outcomes by:
- Demonstrating applied computing and AI skills.
- Reflecting critically on my strengths, challenges, and growth.
- Connecting coursework to broader social, ethical, and global contexts.
- Presenting artefacts that highlight creativity, technical aptitude, and employability.
