## Welcome

Welcome to my academic e-portfolio! This space documents my journey through the MSc Artificial Intelligence programme at the University of Essex Online.

## Purpose of This Portfolio

This e-portfolio serves multiple purposes:

1. **Documentation** – A comprehensive record of coursework, projects, and learning milestones
2. **Reflection** – Critical analysis of my strengths, challenges, and growth throughout the programme
3. **Showcase** – Demonstration of technical skills, creativity, and professional development
4. **Connection** – Linking academic learning to broader social, ethical, and global contexts

## What You'll Find Here

### Module Artefacts

Each module will have dedicated sections containing:
- Coursework and assignments
- Project documentation
- Code repositories and technical implementations
- Reflections on learning outcomes

### Research & Publications

As I progress through the programme, I'll share:
- Research papers and literature reviews
- Technical explorations and experiments
- Findings from applied AI projects

### Professional Development

This section tracks my growth in:
- Employability skills
- Communication and presentation abilities
- Teamwork and collaboration
- Leadership and project management

### Reflections

Regular reflective entries will explore:
- Challenges encountered and overcome
- Key learnings and insights
- Applications to real-world problems
- Connections between theory and practice

## About My Background

I bring 15+ years of software engineering experience from finance, banking, energy, and security sectors. This practical foundation enriches my academic study of AI, allowing me to bridge theoretical concepts with real-world applications.

My interests span:
- **AI & Machine Learning** – particularly workflow mining and specification-driven development
- **Structured Workflows** – applying modular, systematic approaches to complex problems
- **Responsible AI** – ethical considerations and governance in AI deployment
- **Applied Research** – translating academic insights into practical solutions

## Looking Ahead

This portfolio will evolve throughout my MSc journey. I'm excited to explore cutting-edge AI topics, contribute to research, and develop solutions that address real-world challenges.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find this portfolio both informative and engaging!
