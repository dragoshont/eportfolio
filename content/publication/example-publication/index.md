## Introduction

This work examines how structured, modular approaches from software engineering can enhance AI development processes. Drawing on 15+ years of experience building robust systems and ongoing academic study in artificial intelligence, it proposes a framework for specification-driven AI development.

## Key Concepts

### Modular Thinking

Breaking complex AI systems into manageable, testable components that can be developed, validated, and deployed independently.

### Checklist-Driven Development

Applying systematic verification approaches to ensure quality, reproducibility, and ethical considerations throughout the AI development lifecycle.

### Workflow Mining

Leveraging machine learning to analyze and optimize development workflows, identifying patterns and bottlenecks in the AI delivery pipeline.

## Future Directions

This research will continue as part of the MSc AI programme, with planned applications in:

- MLOps and model deployment
- AI governance and responsible AI frameworks
- Requirements engineering for AI systems
- Automated workflow analysis and optimization
