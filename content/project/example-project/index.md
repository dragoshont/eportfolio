## Overview

This project explores the intersection of AI, workflow mining, and specification-driven development. The goal is to develop methods for automatically extracting, analyzing, and optimizing workflows in complex software systems.

## Objectives

- Apply machine learning techniques to workflow analysis
- Develop specification-driven approaches to system design
- Create reproducible, modular solutions for workflow optimization
- Investigate ethical considerations in AI-driven automation

## Status

Currently in the research and planning phase as part of the MSc AI programme at the University of Essex Online.
